## About 

This is my own theme edit of [Etterna](https://github.com/etternagame/etterna)'s theme "Til Death", the goal of this repository is to document the changes/fixes i make while giving out an public release of the theme 

At the moment, this theme **is only playable on 0.73, and in a ratio of 16:9**, i will not fix anything in regards on 4:3 or other different versions

This version of the theme has some stuff missing from 0.72.3, mostly experimental stuff but i will try to finish them soon

## Credits

- Poco0137
- Steffen for the grade counter logic
- Sidek for the titlesplash animation, for porting the xoon 3 particule system and inspiration on the ScreenEvaluation layout
- MISSILE228 for some graphic stuff (mainly the main menu artwork)
  
i will finish it whenever im not lazy but this is essential atm

It doesn't change a lot in terms of gameplay but im open to suggestions

## TODO:
- fix the offsetpoint pointer
- finally implement the volume control
- maybe rework a bit more some tabs before going on more miscellaneous stuff
- fix the font kanjis for the love of god
- implement more ideas, or qols, or maybe more paritys from rebirth
