## About 

This is my own theme edit of [Etterna](https://github.com/etternagame/etterna)'s theme "Til Death", the goal of this repository is to document the changes/fixes i make while giving out an public release of the theme 

## Credits

- Poco0137
- Sidek for the titlesplash animation, for porting the xoon 3 particule system and inspiration on the ScreenEvaluation layout
- MISSILE228 for some graphic stuff (mainly the main menu artwork)
  
i will finish it whenever im not lazy but this is essential atm 

## TODO:
- fix roomsearch in multiplayer
- fix unicode font size (or just use another font, i'll see what i can do)
- fix some values and actually put the effort in fixing some positions (this is in order of making 4:3 playable)
- this is related to the last point but atm i will try to fix some things in the EvaluationScreen
- fix the etterna judgment converter and other stuff broken in ScreenEvaluation
- not be lazy and delete some things i just left in _xoon2
- do some changes to the SongWheel and some changes to the tabs
