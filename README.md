## About 

This is my own theme edit of [Etterna](https://github.com/etternagame/etterna)'s theme "Til Death", the goal of this repository is to document the changes/fixes i make while giving out an public release of the theme 

At the moment, this theme **is only playable on 0.72.3, and in a ratio of 16:9**, i will not fix anything in regards on 4:3 or other different versions

## Credits

- Poco0137
- Sidek for the titlesplash animation, for porting the xoon 3 particule system and inspiration on the ScreenEvaluation layout
- MISSILE228 for some graphic stuff (mainly the main menu artwork)
  
i will finish it whenever im not lazy but this is essential atm

It doesn't change a lot in terms of gameplay but im open to suggestions

## TODO:

- fix scrollwheel.lua 
- not be lazy and delete some things i just left in _xoon2
- implement ideas (such as durvin's edit of ScreenEvaluation and other stuff from other themes)
